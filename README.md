# Using Claude Code for Behavioural Data Analysis

A demonstration of how **Claude Code** — Anthropic's agentic AI coding tool — can set up, structure, and run a complete behavioural data analysis pipeline from scratch, with minimal user input.

The analysis uses data from the **Inspection Game**, a two-player economic task in which human participants chose to *work* or *shirk* against a computer-controlled employer over 150 trials.

---

## What This Repository Demonstrates

This repository shows the difference between interacting with an AI coding assistant **without** and **with** structured project context — and then letting it autonomously execute a full analysis workflow.

---

## Getting Started with Claude Code

### Installation

Claude Code runs in your terminal and requires [Node.js](https://nodejs.org/) (v18+).

```bash
npm install -g @anthropic/claude-code
```

Then authenticate:

```bash
claude
```

Follow the prompts to log in with your Anthropic account.

### Useful Commands

Once inside a Claude Code session, use these built-in slash commands:

| Command | Description |
|---|---|
| `/model` | Show or switch the current model |
| `/usage` | View token usage for the current session |
| `/context` | Show what context (files, memory) is loaded |
| `/clear` | Clear the conversation and start fresh |
| `/help` | List all available commands |
| `/quit` | Exit the session |

---

## The Demonstration Workflow

### Step 1 — Ask Claude about the repository (no context)

Start with a bare-bones project containing only the raw data file `human_ig_data.csv`. Open a Claude Code session in the project directory:

```bash
cd your-project-folder
claude
```

Then ask:

`What does this repository contain, and what analyses could I run on this data?`

Claude will give a generic response — it can inspect the CSV and make inferences, but it has no knowledge of the study design, variable names, planned analyses, or preferred tools.

---

### Step 2 — Add the CLAUDE.md and ask again

Copy the provided `CLAUDE.md` template into the project root. This file contains structured instructions about the study design, repository layout, required packages, planned analyses, and agent behaviour guidelines.

Then ask the same question:

`What does this repository contain, and what analyses could I run on this data?`

This time Claude's response will be substantially more informed — it now understands the payoff matrix, the roles of each variable, the analysis goals, and how the project should be structured.

---

### Step 3 — Ask Claude to execute the full workflow

With `CLAUDE.md` in place, ask Claude to work through the project setup and analyses autonomously:

`Please work through all of the tasks described in CLAUDE.md`

Claude will then execute a multi-step agentic workflow, including:

- Initialising the repository structure (folders, config files)
- Setting up the R environment with `renv`
- Writing a data preparation script (`r/00_data_preparation.R`)
- Creating a Quarto analysis document (`qmd/behaviour.qmd`)
- Running the analyses and saving outputs
- Making descriptive Git commits at each stage

---

## What Gets Generated

Running through the full workflow produces the following:

```

    └── tables/                   # Summary tables
```

### Analyses Produced

The `behaviour.qmd` document contains two discrete analyses:

1. **Descriptive statistics** — summary of participant age, gender, and trial counts
2. **Age and gender effects on payoff** — mean payoff per trial broken down by group and gender

---

## Reproducing the Analysis

### 1. Restore the R environment

Open the project in RStudio or set your working directory to the project root, then run:

```r
renv::restore()
```

### 2. Render the analysis

From the terminal:

```bash
quarto render
```
